### **Notes (Main Content)**  

#### **CIA Triad Overview**  
- A **comprehensive security program** must include:  
  1. **Confidentiality** – Protection from unauthorized access.  
  2. **Integrity** – Protection from unauthorized changes.  
  3. **Availability** – Ensuring access when needed.  

#### **Confidentiality**  
- Prevents **identity theft, system compromise, legal issues, and reputation damage**.  
- To determine confidentiality needs:  
  - Who is authorized?  
  - Are there regulations (HIPAA, GDPR)?  
  - What’s the impact of disclosure?  
- **Protection Methods:**  
  - **Access controls**, **Encryption**, **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**.  

#### **Integrity**  
- Ensures data is **accurate, complete, and consistent** across:  
  - **Storage**  
  - **Processing**  
  - **Transmission**  
- **Types of Data Integrity:**  
  1. **Physical Integrity** – Protects physical systems.  
  2. **Logical Integrity** – Prevents human errors & cyber threats.  
- **Threats:** Unauthorized changes in:  
  - Financial records, health records, news, vote counts, etc.  
- **Protection Methods:**  
  - **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**  
  - **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs)**  

#### **Availability**  
- Ensures **authorized users** have **immediate & reliable access** to data.  
- **Threats to Availability:**  
  - **Non-malicious:** Hardware failures, downtime, network issues.  
  - **Malicious:** DoS (Denial of Service) attacks & sabotage.  
- **Protection Methods:**  
  - **Network monitoring**, **Redundant hardware**, **Backup servers**.  

#### **Regulatory Standards & Penalties**  
- **HIPAA** (USA) – Protects health information.  
- **GDPR** (EU) – Regulates digital privacy.  
- **Consequences of Non-Compliance:** Fines, penalties, and reputational damage.

### **Summary**  
- The **CIA Triad** ensures **data security** by protecting **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**.  
- **Breaches** cause **financial losses** for both businesses & consumers.  
- **Regulations** (HIPAA, GDPR) enforce data protection, and **non-compliance** leads to heavy fines.

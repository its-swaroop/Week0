### **Notes (Main Content)**  

#### **Information Assets & Data Processing**  
- **Information Asset:** Any valuable data, e.g., patient records, customer data, IP.  
- **Data Analytics:** Converts raw data into meaningful information.  
  - **Data** = raw values/facts (e.g., page views, sales).  
  - **Information** = processed data (e.g., trends from sales).  
  - **Insights** = conclusions from data (e.g., best sales strategy).  

#### **Intellectual Property (IP)**  
- **Definition:** Creations of the mind, protected by copyright, trademarks, and patents.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Industrial designs, trade secrets, research discoveries.  
  - Employee knowledge may also be considered IP.  
- **Protection Methods:**  
  - **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)** prevent leaks.  

#### **Digital Products & Protection**  
- **Examples:** Software, eBooks, music, online courses, web elements.  
- **Risks:** Piracy, reverse engineering, unauthorized access.  
- **Protection Tools:**  
  - **Digital Rights Management (DRM):** Prevents unauthorized copying.  
  - **DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act):** Protects against copyright violations.  

#### **Data-Driven Decision Making**  
- Uses captured data to improve business strategies.  
- **Sources of Data Capture:**  
  - Server logs, IoT sensors, customer surveys.  
- **Data Correlation:** Analyzing raw data to find connections.  
  - Example: Netflix predicting popular shows using user data.  
- **AI & Machine Learning:** Automate data analysis for faster insights.  

#### **Confidential Information & Data Security**  
- **Types of Confidential Information:**  
  1. **PII (Personally Identifiable Information):** Identifies a person (e.g., name, ID, address).  
  2. **Company Confidential Info:** Business-critical data (e.g., IP, employee records).  
  3. **Customer Confidential Info:** Includes PII and purchase history, credit card info.  
  4. **PHI (Protected Health Information):** Medical records linked to an individual.  

#### **Proper Handling of Confidential Data**  
✅ Restrict access only to authorized personnel.  
✅ Store data securely using encryption, firewalls, permissions.  
✅ Destroy unnecessary file copies (don’t just discard them).  
✅ Obtain consent before processing/storing data.  
✅ Strong password policies (change passwords quarterly).  

#### **PII vs. PCI vs. SPI**  
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information):** Identifies an individual.  
- **PCI (Personal Customer Information):** Identifies & describes a customer (name, demographics).  
- **SPI (Sensitive Personal Information):** Doesn’t identify a person but can be harmful if exposed.

### **Summary**  
- **Data ➝ Information ➝ Insights** are key for decision-making.  
- **Intellectual Property (IP)** includes trade secrets, designs, and employee knowledge.  
- **Digital products** require **DRM & DMCA** protection.  
- **Data security** ensures **PII, company & customer data, and PHI** are protected.  
- **PII, PCI, SPI** have overlapping but distinct meanings.
